## About Me
Hi! I'm an aspiring software engineer. I've been working in retail (specifically online retail store) for 3 years and still think that nothing can toughen one up quite as effectively as working in customer service can. For the last 2 years I worked as an assistant supervisor. I've proven to be a hard-working, ethical, responsible and highly attentive to detail employee. Fingers crossed, this whole front-end development thing-y is a path I can follow.
